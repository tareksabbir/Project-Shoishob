## System Architecture

### Project Overview

Project Shoishob follows a client-side rendered React application architecture with role-based access control. The application provides different views and functionalities based on three primary user roles: Regular User, Admin/Owner, and Super Admin.

![Project Overview](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tareksabbir/Project-Shoishob/main/public/shoishob1.png)

### 1. Routing System

The application uses React Router to manage navigation between different views. Routes are organized into public routes (accessible to all) and protected routes (requiring authentication).

![Routing System](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tareksabbir/Project-Shoishob/main/public/shoishob2.png)

### 2. Authentication and Authorization

The system implements a multi-layered authentication and authorization mechanism:

- **Authentication:** Users authenticate through Firebase
- **JWT Tokens:** Authenticated API requests use bearer tokens
- **Role-Based Authorization:** Different dashboards and capabilities based on user roles

![Authentication and Authorization](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tareksabbir/Project-Shoishob/main/public/shoishob3.png)

### 3. Layout System

The application uses two primary layouts:

- **Main Layout (Main.jsx):** Used for public pages
- **Dashboard Layout (DashBoardLayout.jsx):** Used for authenticated user functionality

![Layout System](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tareksabbir/Project-Shoishob/main/public/shoishob4.png)

### 4. Dashboard System

The dashboard renders different components and navigation options based on the user's role:

![Dashboard System](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tareksabbir/Project-Shoishob/main/public/shoishob5.png)

### 5. Role-Based Access Control

The system implements three primary user roles, each with progressively more capabilities:

| **Role**          | **Responsibilities & Access**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| ----------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Regular User**  | - View turf listings with filters.<br>- Book available turfs by selecting date, time, and players.<br>- View and edit their profile and booking history.<br>- Cancel upcoming bookings (if allowed).<br>- Pay online for confirmed bookings via Stripe or similar (if implemented).                                                                                           |
| **Turf Owner**    | - All features of a Regular User.<br>- Add, update, or delete their own turf listings.<br>- Set availability and slot prices.<br>- Approve or reject booking requests manually or automate it.<br>- Monitor booking performance and earnings.<br>- Host and manage tournaments with bracket creation and team participation.                                                  |
| **Administrator** | - Full system access.<br>- View, approve, or ban users and turf owners.<br>- Add or remove turfs on behalf of owners (if needed).<br>- Oversee all bookings across the platform.<br>- Access earnings reports, platform statistics, and user analytics.<br>- Manage reported issues, disputes, and feedback from users.<br>- Moderate tournament content and public messages. |

### 6. Booking System Architecture

The booking system is a core component of Project Shoishob, allowing users to reserve sports fields:

![Booking System Architecture](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tareksabbir/Project-Shoishob/main/public/shoishob8.png)

### Code Organization

The project follows a feature-based code organization pattern:

![Code Organization](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tareksabbir/Project-Shoishob/main/public/shoishob9.png)

### Component Relationships

The application is built using component composition and context-smd state management:

![Component Relationships](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tareksabbir/Project-Shoishob/main/public/shoishob10.png)

### Protected Routes Implementation

Protected routes are implemented using wrapper components that check authentication status and user roles:
