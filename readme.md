## System Architecture

### Project Overview

Project Shoishob follows a client-side rendered React application architecture with role-based access control. The application provides different views and functionalities based on three primary user roles: Regular User, Admin/Owner, and Super Admin.

![Project Overview](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tareksabbir/Project-Shoishob/main/public/shoishob1.png)

### 1. Routing System

The application uses React Router to manage navigation between different views. Routes are organized into public routes (accessible to all) and protected routes (requiring authentication).

![Routing System](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tareksabbir/Project-Shoishob/main/public/shoishob2.png)

### 2. Authentication and Authorization

The system implements a multi-layered authentication and authorization mechanism:

- **Authentication:** Users authenticate through Firebase
- **JWT Tokens:** Authenticated API requests use bearer tokens
- **Role-Based Authorization:** Different dashboards and capabilities based on user roles

![Authentication and Authorization](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tareksabbir/Project-Shoishob/main/public/shoishob3.png)

### 3. Layout System

The application uses two primary layouts:

- **Main Layout (Main.jsx):** Used for public pages
- **Dashboard Layout (DashBoardLayout.jsx):** Used for authenticated user functionality

![ Layout System](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tareksabbir/Project-Shoishob/main/public/shoishob4.png)

### 4. Dashboard System

The dashboard renders different components and navigation options based on the user's role:

![Dashboard System](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tareksabbir/Project-Shoishob/main/public/shoishob5.png)

### 5. Role-Based Access Control

The system implements three primary user roles, each with progressively more capabilities:

| Role           | API Route              | Capabilities                                                                                                       |
| :------------- | :--------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| User (Regular) | N/A                    | - View profile<br>- Book turfs<br>- View own bookings<br>- View payment history                                    |
| Admin/Owner    | `/api/v1/user/:email`  | - All User capabilities<br>- Manage owned turfs<br>- View all bookings for owned turfs<br>- Add tournaments        |
| Super Admin    | `/api/v1/admin/:email` | - All Admin capabilities<br>- Manage all turfs<br>- Manage all users<br>- View all bookings<br>- Manage all admins |

The dashboard UI adapts to show only the relevant functionality for each role:

### 6. Booking System Architecture

The booking system is a core component of Project Shoishob, allowing users to reserve sports fields:

![Booking System Architecture](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tareksabbir/Project-Shoishob/main/public/shoishob8.png)

### Code Organization

The project follows a feature-based code organization pattern:

![Code Organization](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tareksabbir/Project-Shoishob/main/public/shoishob9.png)

### Component Relationships

The application is built using component composition and context-based state management:

![Component Relationships](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tareksabbir/Project-Shoishob/main/public/shoishob10.png)

### Protected Routes Implementation

Protected routes are implemented using wrapper components that check authentication status and user roles:
